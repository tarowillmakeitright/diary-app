# 📝 Diary App

A privacy-first personal diary that **never stores your data on a server or database**.  
Your entries are saved **locally in your own browser only** — nothing is uploaded, shared, or tracked.

## 🔐 Why This Diary?

Most diary or journal apps store your thoughts in the cloud or in external databases.  
This app takes a different approach:

- ✅ **No database**
- ✅ **No user account**
- ✅ **No server-side storage**
- ✅ **No data tracking**

Your diary belongs to **you** — no one else.

## 🚀 Technology

- HTML + CSS + JavaScript
- Node.js + Express (for static serving)
- Google App Engine (for optional deployment)

---

## 🛡 Privacy by Design

This app does **not**:

- Upload or sync your data to any backend
- Use cookies, analytics, or ads
- Send data to a remote server

Your diary is stored in your browser’s `localStorage`.  
If you clear your browser cache or use incognito mode, your data may be lost.
